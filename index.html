        "body": "I know cars pretty well and usually do all my own work, but I am so glad I took my car to Mark this time around. Mark and his team are awesome! This guy (obviously) KNOWS his Volkswagens. Seriously, one of the most knowledgeable VW mechanics Iâ€™ve ever met. I took my manual transmission Jetta in for a new clutch, pressure plate, bearings, etc and for a noise which I thought was related. Mark quoted me $1300 for doing it with all genuine parts, the VW dealership wanted $2100! He did the clutch work and when the noise still wasnâ€™t completely gone, I got the bad news that my transmission output shaft bearings were shot. Itâ€™s an extremely rare transmission, but Mark was able to find a used one with a warranty in the valley for me for 1/2 of what I was seeing them online for. He was extremely honest the entire process and even showed me what was wrong with my old transmission after it was pulled from the car. He stayed in excellent communication and finished the entire process 3 days earlier than he said he would be done! When I got the car back, it felt brand new again! He didnâ€™t try and sell me services that I didnâ€™t need and did an absolutely fantastic job on my car. I HIGHLY recommend Mark and his team for any repairs and I will 100% be using him in the future again. Thanks again Mark! -A very happy customer."

        "body": "So hereâ€™s the truth about this place and my experience. I have an Audi a3 tdi. Particulate filter and check engine light came on. Took it to my old mechanic down town. They said they donâ€™t do them and go to the dealer. Took it to Audi Lehi they said $4000??? Called these guys and Mike ran me through a bunch of scenarios, most importantly has anyone confirmed itâ€™s the filter or are they just going off the check engine light. This was the only business to ask this and was the only group to walk me through multiple answers based on their experience with tdi.. Turned out it didnâ€™t need to be replaced and saved me a TON of money. They have earned my trust and loyalty based on this experience. Hope they can earn yours too."
